**Rust Expression Parser**

This is a random project I worked on to start learning Rust.
It prompts the user for a string containing an expression, parses it into a binary tree struct, and evaluates it into a float number. It also contains a pretty-print for the tree struct and a random Fibonacci function with a cache vector I used to figure out the basics of borrowing and references. I'll probably expand it in the future when I encounter some more advanced concepts that look like they could fit.
